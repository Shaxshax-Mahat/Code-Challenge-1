# Code-Challenge-1

## Description
This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript coding challenges. Each challenge is implemented in a dedicated folder with its own JavaScript file. The challenges are:

### 1. Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator
- A program to calculate the ingredients required to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan Chai.
- Prompts the user for the number of cups and outputs the required quantities of water, milk, tea leaves, and sugar.

### 2. Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator
- A program to estimate the fare for a boda boda ride based on the distance traveled.
- Uses a base fare and a per-kilometer charge to calculate the total cost.

### 3. Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator
- A program to calculate transaction fees for mobile money transfers.
- Ensures fees adhere to a minimum and maximum limit, then calculates the total amount debited.

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Code-Challenge-2
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the specific challenge you want to test:
   ```bash
   cd chaiCalculator  # For example
   ```

3. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:
